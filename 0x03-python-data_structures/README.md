0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
* Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of any data type, including other lists. Lists are mutable, which means that they can be modified after they are created. Lists are defined using square brackets, and the items in the list are separated by commas.
* Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, which means that they cannot be modified after they are created. Tuples are defined using parentheses, and the items in the tuple are separated by commas.
