0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that allows you to map object-oriented programming concepts to relational database concepts. In Python, there are several ORM libraries that you can use to interact with relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. Some popular Python ORM libraries include:

SQLAlchemy: SQLAlchemy is a popular Python ORM library that supports multiple databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. It provides a rich set of tools for mapping database tables to Python classes, querying the database, and managing database transactions.

Django ORM: Django is a web framework for Python that comes with its own ORM. It allows you to define database models as Python classes and provides an intuitive syntax for querying the database.

Peewee: Peewee is a lightweight and easy-to-use ORM for Python that supports SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL databases. It provides a simple API for mapping database tables to Python classes and querying the database.
