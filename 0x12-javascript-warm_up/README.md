0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development. It was originally created by Brendan Eich in 1995 and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

JavaScript is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create dynamic and interactive web pages. With JavaScript, developers can add interactivity, animations, and other dynamic effects to web pages. For example, they can create drop-down menus, pop-up windows, form validations, and other interactive elements.

JavaScript is a versatile language that can also be used for server-side web development, desktop and mobile application development, and other types of programming tasks. With the introduction of Node.js, developers can now use JavaScript on the server-side to build scalable, high-performance web applications.

Some of the key features of JavaScript include its dynamic typing, functional programming capabilities, and support for object-oriented programming. JavaScript has a large and active community of developers who contribute to open-source libraries and frameworks, making it easier to build complex applications with JavaScript.
